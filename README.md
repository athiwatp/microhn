A microscopic Hacker News client built on top of [GraphQLHub](https://www.graphqlhub.com/).

You don't need any frameworks to build an app with GraphQL. Just a `script` tag and some browser APIs!

Note: not all browsers are currently supported due to use of `fetch` and template literals. Those were just the fastest way for me to get this done, so I welcome PRs to make this even simpler!
